                of the game is to survive as long as you can. After reaching a certain score by killing mobs they are
                provided with the opportunity to select one ability from a list of abilities displayed on screen.
                
                I'm aiming for a minimalistic design, featuring square-shaped player characters and mobs distinguished by
                different colours. To enhance the visual appeal, I've incorporated blooming effects and camera shakes,
                lending a futuristic and engaging feel. Despite the minimalism, I plan to introduce additional effects and
                animations for both players and mobs in the future.

                Currently, the map is restricted to the size of the camera view. I intend to maintain this confined space,
                creating a survival challenge for the player, unlike other games where exploration involves traversing larger
                maps. However, this design choice presents potential balancing issues. For instance, a small map size may
                lead to challenges such as an abundance of mobs causing the player to rapidly lose health, thus increasing
                the game's difficulty due to limited manoeuvring space.

    portfolio_description: `The 2.5D Clone Platformer is a compact project I developed during my free time. The concept for this game
                emerged from a suggestion by ChatGPT when I sought a smaller-scale project idea. Throughout the development
                phase, I focused on rapidly prototyping the features proposed by ChatGPT, specifically centred around
                integrating a clone within the platformer game. This clone serves to assist the player in accessing
                unreachable areas and engaging with triggers that would otherwise be beyond the player's reach.
                
                Since this project was primarily focused on quickly establishing the mechanics, I didn't dedicate extensive
                effort to the level's design or embellishments. Nevertheless, I incorporated a level-completion animation and
                enhanced the player's appearance by adding glasses instead of a basic cube model.

                The player can summon a clone by pressing a designated button. Once the clone is summoned, the player becomes
                immobilized while the clone can utilize the player as a platform to access areas otherwise unreachable.
                Incorporating this feature with a well-crafted level design has the potential to create an engaging and
                challenging gaming experience, offering an enjoyable gameplay dynamic.

    portfolio_description: `This 2D project was developed as part of my university game jam coursework. Over six weeks, we were presented
                with a new game theme each week, and I meticulously managed tasks and game concepts to ensure their
                feasibility within the given time frame. Upon completing the core mechanics of each game, I dedicated
                additional time to refining and expanding the gameplay, including the creation of extra levels.

                The theme for my third week of the game jam was "Light and Dark." During the planning phase, I generated two
                distinct game ideas. The initial concept involved a platformer with contrasting dark and light-coloured
                platforms. The second idea centred around a 2D game where the player wielded a torch to illuminate their
                path, introducing a challenge by leaving areas behind and to the sides of the player in darkness. Ultimately,
                I chose my first idea at last as I had more mechanic ideas for the first game during the time.

                In refining the first game concept, I conceived an innovative approach to differentiate it from conventional
                platformers. Instead of pre-designed platforms, I allowed users to create their own, adding a unique twist to
                the gameplay. To maintain a level of challenge, I incorporated obstacles that players needed to navigate
                around while creating their platforms.

    portfolio_description: `During my time at university, I worked on developing a 2D project for my coursework that had a Chinese CCG
                theme. I was inspired to choose this theme as there were very few such themes in the field. My understanding
                of Chinese culture and background helped me to create various elements such as cards, characters, and audio
                components.

                In my exploration of the Three Kingdoms concept, I am incorporating characters from this historical period,
                aligning their abilities, mana, attack, and defence closely with their real-life counterparts. For instance,
                drawing inspiration from Hua Tuo, a renowned surgeon during the Three Kingdoms era, I depict him as a healing
                character, reflecting his historical role. Considering his age and frailty, I assign him low attack and
                defence attributes. This approach extends to other characters, ensuring a faithful representation for a more
                immersive character environment.

                Each card in the project features essential details such as mana cost, attack, defence, name, description,
                and character image. Similarly, for enemy characters, the display includes their name, attack, health, and an
                accompanying character image. This meticulous alignment strives to create a realistic and engaging portrayal
                of the characters within the game environment.

                The game mechanics are designed as a single-player Rogue-like Collectible Card Game (CCG). Players engage by
                strategically dragging and dropping cards onto enemy containers to initiate attacks. Within each round, a
                30-second timer challenges players to strategically place their cards before the enemy's counterattack.
                Subsequently, a new timer prompts players to interact with buttons, determining the duration of their actions
                before initiating the next round.

                Mana plays a crucial role in card deployment. To accumulate mana, players must click on randomly generated
                blue buttons that appear on screen each round, adding an element of luck to the resource management aspect.
                This introduces a need for players to plan their attacks, accumulate mana strategically, and unleash powerful
                combos. Success hinges on effective mana and combo management, as players aim to eliminate enemies using the
                cards in their hands.

                The game unfolds in waves, with each wave presenting a new set of challenges as players progress through
                enemy spawns. Strategic planning, efficient mana utilization, and adept combo execution become essential for
                achieving the goal of defeating enemies and progressing through successive waves.
